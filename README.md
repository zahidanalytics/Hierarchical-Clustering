## 2. Grouping Wines using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

**Objective:**  
Group wines based on chemical properties to discover natural wine profiles.

**Dataset:**  
- **Source:** [UCI Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)  
- **Features:** Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Color intensity, Proline, etc.  

**Methodology:**  
- Standardized chemical features  
- Applied **Wardâ€™s method** for hierarchical clustering  
- Dendrogram visualization for cluster exploration  
- Cluster-wise chemical profile analysis  

**Key Insight:**  
Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct wine groups, each with unique chemical compositions.
